## Lyngarr's Wandering Pets 🐕🐈‍⬛🦜

Lyngarr's Wandering Pets is a simple mod that lets your tamed pets roam freely within a defined area. Just **sneak + right-click** on your pet to toggle between **Wandering** and **Following** mode.

### 2.0.0 Features

- **Per-pet home points**: When you toggle a pet to Wandering mode, it sets a home at the current location.
- **32-block wandering radius**: Your pet will explore within a 32-block radius and automatically return in the home area if it strays too far.
- **Different dimensions support**: Each pet remembers separate home points for different dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End, etc.).
- **Adjusted cat behavior**: The vanilla behavior of cats that make them sit on furniture is a bit nerfed while in wandering mode, otherwise they would just sit and basically never move.

This mod is **server-side**, meaning you can install it on a server without requiring players to have Fabric or any additional mods. It also works perfectly in singleplayer.
