## Lyngarr's Wandering Pets 🐕🐈‍⬛🦜

Lyngarr’s Wandering Pets is a simple mod that lets your pets roam freely whenever you want. Just **sneak + right-click** on your pet to toggle between **Wandering** and **Following** mode.  

While similar mods exist, I couldn't find one for the latest version—so I made my own!  

This mod is **server-side**, meaning you can install it on a server without requiring players to have Fabric or any additional mods. It also works perfectly in singleplayer.    

⚠ **Note:** This is my first ever mod, so I’m still learning! If you have any advice, I’d love to hear it.
